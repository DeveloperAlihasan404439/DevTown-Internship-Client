I would like to explain everything in the assignment task given by you.

Basically this is a Product searching related website. where are different routes.  Home, All Product, Dashboard, Shop Crad, Log In, Sign Up, and Log Out. These brand only click in the brand related products in the display. If an user is logged in then he/she will able to see the brand products. That means these are private routes. There are also a banner section.

This website is mainly authentication based system. That means an user must be registered before log in to the website. If an user is logged in then he/she will see the his/her shop prodcts.

When some one click on the all products then he/she will enter in to the all products page. where there is a serch option by which he/she will able to serch desired product by price, name, type, processor, memory, OS and thera is a sorting option based on products brand, 

After clicking buy now button the product will be added to the crad list and redirect the crad page will be displayed. 

Only logged in user can get access to the all products page because i heve implemented a user athentication system.

Dashboart only access the admin. if admin clicking the dashboart route the display.where there is all products, all user, all crad list data. if admin clicking on any route then that route related data will be displayed.
